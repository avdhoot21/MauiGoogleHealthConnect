# HealthConnect SDK Integration in .NET MAUI (This App is still in Development)

This project demonstrates how to integrate **Google's HealthConnect SDK** into a **.NET MAUI** application using **Java Bindings**. The solution allows you to read and write health-related data such as steps, heart rate, and more, from Android devices.

## Overview

This project integrates **HealthConnect SDK** into a **.NET MAUI** Android app. **HealthConnect** is a platform developed by Google for accessing health-related data such as steps, heart rate, and other fitness metrics from supported Android devices.

The integration is achieved by creating a **Java Bindings Library** for the **HealthConnect AAR file**, which allows **.NET MAUI** to interact with the Java code in the SDK.

This repository contains:

- **Platform-Specific Android Code**: Interacts with the HealthConnect SDK via Java bindings.
- **Shared .NET MAUI Interface**: Provides a cross-platform abstraction to interact with the platform-specific implementation.
- **Example of Using HealthConnect in .NET MAUI**: Demonstrates reading and writing health data (e.g., steps count, heart rate).

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

1. **Android SDK** installed on your machine.
2. **Google HealthConnect SDK** packaged as an **AAR file** (Android Archive).
3. **Visual Studio** (latest stable version) with **.NET MAUI** support installed.
4. **Android Studio** to generate the AAR file from your Java project if not already available.

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. HealthConnect AAR Creation

To use **HealthConnect SDK** in .NET MAUI, you first need to create an **AAR file** from your Java-based HealthConnect SDK. 

- Create an **Android Library Project** in **Android Studio**.
- Add the **HealthConnect SDK** and your custom code to the project.
- Build the project to generate the **AAR file** (this will be placed in `build/outputs/aar/`).

### 2. Adding AAR to .NET MAUI

Once you have the **HealthConnect AAR** file:

- Add the **AAR file** to your **.NET MAUI project**.
- Place the **AAR file** in a folder such as `Resources/Raw`.
- In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **AAR file** and set the **Build Action** to **AndroidLibrary**.
- Build the solution so that the **.NET MAUI** project can reference the AAR.

### 3. Java Bindings Project

To enable your **.NET MAUI** project to call the Java code in the AAR, you need to create a **Java Bindings Library**.

- Add a **Java Bindings Library** project to the solution.
- Add the **HealthConnect AAR** to the bindings project.
- Build the bindings to generate C# wrappers for the Java methods exposed in the AAR.

### 4. Platform-Specific Android Implementation

In your **MAUI Android project**, create a platform-specific implementation that interacts with the **HealthConnectManager** class from the Java bindings. This implementation will handle tasks like reading and writing health data (e.g., steps, heart rate).

- Define methods to check availability, read data, and write data using the HealthConnectManager.

### 5. Shared Code Implementation

Create a shared interface in your **.NET MAUI** project that abstracts platform-specific code. The shared code will use **DependencyService** to call the platform-specific methods implemented in the Android project.

### 6. Permissions

Ensure your application requests the necessary permissions to access health data:

- Add the appropriate permissions in your **AndroidManifest.xml** (e.g., `ACCESS_HEALTH_DATA`).
- Handle runtime permissions in the **MainActivity.cs**.

---

## Testing

1. **Deploy the app to a physical Android device** (HealthConnect may not fully function on all emulators).
2. **Test the functionality**:
   - Verify that HealthConnect is available on the device.
   - Check if the app can read and write health data (e.g., steps, heart rate).

Make sure that the appropriate **permissions** are granted to the app on the device.

---

## Additional Notes

- **HealthConnect Compatibility**: Ensure that your device supports HealthConnect. You can check this by querying the HealthConnect SDK for availability.
- **Permissions**: Always request the necessary permissions (e.g., access to health data) at runtime.
- **Platform-Specific Code**: This implementation uses **DependencyService** to access the platform-specific code for Android.

This project is designed to demonstrate the integration of HealthConnect SDK into .NET MAUI, which allows reading and writing health-related data on Android devices.
